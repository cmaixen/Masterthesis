##Exploring The Data

During this research we'll research the possibilities of user authentication, by  using machine learning. More specificly we'll research the possibilities of authenticating users based on canvas fingerprints, produced by the html5 canvas functionality.

### The Canvas Fingerprint

the idea behind this research is to explore the possiblities on how we can identify a certain device, based on a certain amount of fingerprints.

For the moment we assume the 2000 canvases are enough to identify a certain device.
The size of the canvases is 300 x 150 and is generated by drawing a random generated string in several colors on the canvas. The following image is an example of such generated canvas:

###Orientation

A quick way to explore data is to map it to a two dimensional space. This is what we did for the orientaion. We reduced every canvas image to two features and plotted it.

We converted every image to a flat matrix, by taking the RGBA values for every pixel. Afterwards I used RandomizedPCA the matrix to two feautures.

###Results


First we plotted the canvases of an unknown device and our own device.
This gave a promising result as you can see in the picture below.

Note that we only had information about our device (80), which is a* Macbook Pro 15 inch with OSX El Capitain and a Chrome browser.* The other red datapoints were from a unkown device with an unknown browser and OS. 

The good results could be good luck and we needed more info. We tried first to plot drawings by several browsers on the same computer. As you can  see we did not make a clear seperation between the different browsers (if we reduced it to 2 features). **This raises the question what  if the user uses several browsers? This is something very difficult to check during the datagathering. How should we treat this? Also is this an indication that the browser is not the keyfactor in the uniqueness of the canvases?**

For the next test we used 3 different devices with all different browsers.

*	Macbook Pro 15 inch, OSX El Capitain , Chrome Browser 
*	Mac 5k, OSX El Capitain, Safari
*	Iphone 6, IOS 10, Safari Mobile


Again we see now a clear seperation between the devices. Note that we have here only Apple software and the plot is still a reduction from 180k to 2 features. **But maybe is this an indication that Apple software is to universal and no clear seperation is possible?!

As an extra we added an extra plot of only the two different OS X devices.

At last, to explore the influences of the OS on the canvases. We used our macbook's native OS and 2 OS's from VM's. Again do we see a similar result, where no clear seperation is possible.

*  Macbook Pro 15 inch, OSX El Capitain , Chrome Browser 
*  Macbook Pro 15 inch, Kali Linux, Iceweasel (VM)
*  Macbook Pro 15 inch, Windows 10, Internet Explorer (VM)

It is clear that we needed more data and more information about the data to have a clear view on the data and to detect several problems.

###Conclusion

From 180k to 2 features is a massive reduction and these small experiments where a good idea to have a first indication of the data. At least now we know now that their is a possibility to make a clear seperation but to determine this, we need more data about the canvasses we received. If it is not just to understand the performances and the possible problems. 

More research and more data is needed. Also the idea of these small experiments was to get a visual idea on how we can classify the canvases. In future research we need to try this with more data, other reduction techniques and have already a few simple classification techniques to measure their performance.
